An introductory tour of modern JavaScript

**Goals**

- Quick run through of what makes up modern JS. Building blocks, syntax, and thinking in JS (or just about any programming language)

**Non-goals**

- We won't be covering specialty applications of the language features, i.e, in building of (web/mobile/desktop) Spatial applications.

**Prerequisites**

- None!
- But if you have a browser / node installed, you can happily start tinkering

**Resources**

1. [MDN Resources- The absolute go-to for comprehensive documentation of JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

2. [Free Code Camp : JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

3. [JavaScript vs Python: Equivalents](https://dev.to/djangotricks/equivalents-in-python-and-javascript-part-3-4icc)

**Topics**

2. [Types](./types.md)

3. [Control Structures](./control.md)

4. [Functions](./functions.md)

5. [Extras](./extras.md)

### Supplementary Topics, Stuff. üê£

**Operators**

We've been using a subset of these in the code snippets. For a comprehensive list, see [Expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).

**Typing**

JS has *dynamic typing* - type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time. Compare to: *static typing*

JS has *loose typing* - Freedom! You dont have to say a spade is a spade. A bucket can be a spade! Compare to: *strong typing*

Look up
- Type casting
- Type coercion
- Type coersion

Enjoy talks on TypeScript, Flow... It'll save your life!

**Structured Data**

- Structuring data using [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), and spatial data using [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/).

Hint: These two data structues syntactically look like JavaScript, have JavaScript in the name, and have exactly nothing else to do with JavaScript ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
