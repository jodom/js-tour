# Operators

- arithmetic `+`, `-`, `/`, `%`
- assignment `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--`, `...`
- comparison `===` and `==`
- relational `in`, `instanceof`
- unary `delete`, `typeof`, `void`
- conditional (tenary) `true ? a : b`

We'll naturally pick up a subset of these in the code snippets. For a comprehensive list, see [Expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).
